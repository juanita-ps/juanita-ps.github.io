title:  Hola, I'm Juanita Pardo Sanchez

I was born in Colombia and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I attended Georgia Tech for my undergraduate degree where I ran D1 cross country and track. I graduated with my PhD from the University of Michigan where I studied the development of cognition. 

I am actively seeking full-time positions as a data analyst, as I love to analyze and communicate data. I primarily work in R but have experience in Python and SQL.
